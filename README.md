# CrudAndroid
This is an simple Crud app with SQLite.

This app is an app to starters that are still learning how to use the SQLite with Android (like me) and I'll try to leave the code in an easy way to understand. Hope you enjoy it.

If you try to delete it's going to appear a message on screen asking if you really want to delete the user.
